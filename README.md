# GEO Protocol

**GEO** is an open protocol for a decentralized credit network designed to organize mutual credit economies within and between local communities.

Instead of using traditional money, GEO participants:
- Open **lines of trust** for each other (credit limits)
- Perform **payments** via the trust network (chains of connections)
- Automatically **clear debts** in closed cycles

GEO is **not** a cryptocurrency (no tokens, no mining), **not** a blockchain (no global ledger), and **not** a bank (the hub does not own funds and does not decide for participants).
