# GEO: How to Fix Money Without Making a Revolution

Imagine that in your city or district something strange suddenly appears. It doesn't print money, doesn't distribute grants, and doesn't wave slogans about "new world order". It simply quietly makes it easier for people and small businesses to exchange what they have: time, work, goods, services.

Someone helps a neighbor with repairs and gets not "thanks and promise to repay someday", but quite specific credit. Someone prints leaflets for local cooperative and thus pays for English lessons. The corner store partially settles with local bakery not with hryvnia, but with mutual credit: "you give me bread, I give you room cleaning and advertising".

And all this — without a bank in the middle, without micro-credits at crazy interest, and without another "super-cryptocurrency".

This is what the GEO project revolves around. If very briefly, GEO is an attempt to assemble a clear, understandable and technically feasible way to do **trust economy**: when money is not only numbers in a bank account, but also a network of agreements between people and communities.

Further will be talk about money, trust, local exchange systems and why we're relaunching the GEO idea in simpler and more grounded form.

## Why Something's Wrong with Money

Writing that "money is evil" is populism. Money is a brilliant invention. Without it we'd still walk around with potato sacks arguing how many haircut hours cost one accordion lesson.

But current monetary system arrangement has several flaws particularly painful for ordinary people, local communities and small business.

First flaw — constant value outflow from local economy.

Take a familiar cafe in your district. You paid 200 hryvnias there. Formally money stayed "in economy". But if broken down by layers, it's not so cheerful. Part goes to bank for acquiring and credit service. Significant share goes to large supplier, possibly not even local. Something else dissolves in taxes and rent. And only thin remainder settles as income for specific people — cooks, baristas, owners who live near you.

Local economy behaves like a leaky bucket: no matter how much you pour in, it still leaks out.

Second flaw — nature of modern money as interest-bearing debt.

New money appears in system mainly through loans. Someone takes them to buy house, open business, cover cash gap. But this money needs to be returned with interest. Interest isn't initially "printed", it needs to be obtained somewhere. As result large number of people and companies constantly run ahead of train: must grow, earn, increase turnover, just not to drown in interest payments.

Attempt to imagine world where "everyone immediately pays off loans and lives peacefully" runs into boring math: not enough money for such repayment. System is arranged so movement doesn't stop. Someone benefits from this, but definitely not small communities.

Third flaw — chronic liquidity shortage "on the ground".

Small business, self-employed, cooperatives constantly have same situation: plenty of work, sufficient resources around, people ready to do something, but right now no free money for prepayment.

You can repair bakery, but bakery can't pay you yet. But it could feed your workers breakfasts for a month. And you could help designers, and designers — lawyers... This network of mutual opportunities exists in heads but hardly reflects in real numbers. Because between all these people stands one monolithic filter — national currency that must first be obtained somewhere.

Fourth flaw — high centralization and vulnerability.

Our money lives through banks, government, payment systems. Any failure — and local economic life stops. Turned off acquiring — and half of small business panics. Changed interest rate — and suddenly yesterday's business plans no longer add up.

All this isn't reason to cancel money and arrange barter communism. But it's good reason to ask: can we add another layer to existing system — more flexible, humane, built on trust and transparent rules?

## What Was Tried Before Us

People troubled by these questions have been plenty over last hundred-plus years. From their attempts several interesting directions were born.

In 80s LETS systems started appearing in different countries — Local Exchange Trading Systems. Each LETS is based on simple idea: let's keep account of who helped whom and how much, in conventional units. Not as "promise in words", but as system records. If I trim your garden and you later help me with website — these services can be credited even if we do them not same day and not in direct exchange.

Time banks emerged bit earlier. There human time hour was unit of measurement. Hour of accounting consultation and hour helping elderly person at home — formally equal. Such system emphasized that not everything in world is measured only by market price.

There are larger examples. Switzerland has had WIR for almost century — mutual credit system between enterprises. There companies can settle with each other in special unit pegged to franc. In crisis years this system helped business survive when regular money was scarce.

All these projects have common nerve: people don't want to constantly depend on centralized money that's hard to get, easy to lose and difficult to keep within community. They seek ways to build parallel exchange systems — softer, more flexible.

But these initiatives have common problems too. They're often local, closed, technologically poorly equipped and hardly interact with each other. One LETS in small town knows nothing about neighboring one. Time bank works separately from cooperative, cooperative — separately from city mutual aid project.

As result each such system lives its own life, and many fade away without becoming truly mainstream.

## What GEO Proposes

GEO starts with very simple question: can we give communities tool that:

allows them to **create their mutual credit and exchange systems** as easily as creating messenger group now;

and meanwhile makes these systems **compatible with each other**, so they can form something like "internet of value" rather than set of isolated interest circles?

Answer we're seeking sounds like: yes, if we make not another coin, but **protocol and software platform**.

GEO has no "unified GEO currency" to dance around. Instead there's concept of equivalent — value measurement unit. Equivalent can be hryvnia, work hour, kilowatt-hour, "cooperative internal unit" and much more. Each equivalent lives by its rules, but all arranged identically: just unit of account.

Instead of storing abstract "balance" at each participant, GEO proposes looking at economy as **trust and debt graph**.

Trust line can exist between two participants: "I'm ready for you to owe me up to hundred units in this equivalent". This isn't debt yet, rather credit limit one participant gives another.

But debts are specific records: "you owe me sixty".

If all such connections are drawn on one picture, you get network: people and organizations are points, and debt arrows stretch between them.

Payment in GEO isn't "hand-to-hand" money transfer in usual sense. It's changing these arrows. Sometimes — directly: you paid someone who trusts you directly. Sometimes — chain through common acquaintances or partners.

Most interesting starts when cycles appear in network. Say A owes B, B owes C, C owes A. Seems everyone owes something, but real value circling around doesn't increase. GEO can notice such cycle and reduce all three debts by same amount. Result: everyone became easier, and total debt sum in system — less. This is called clearing, netting. It's long known in corporate and banking practice, but GEO tries to make it accessible at ordinary people and local community level.

Important that all this doesn't cancel existing money. GEO doesn't compete with hryvnia or dollar, but creates parallel layer where part of exchanges can be closed by mutual credit, not only cash or bank transfers.

If you have money — wonderful, they can be combined with GEO. If money is temporarily insufficient, but desire and possibility to exchange exist — GEO provides additional tools for this.

## Reference: What Happened Earlier with GEO and Why We're Making "v0.1"

GEO idea as "internet of value" was already raised several years ago. The GEO protocol as we know it today is the result of a long evolution and, unfortunately, the loss of its original vision. Initially, it was a grand project to create an "internet of value": a universal system for mutual settlement built on trust rather than money. Technically, it was meticulously designed, from its own p2p architecture to the most complex payment routing algorithms.

But its technical elegance became its curse. The project proved to be so complex that it alienated its primary audience—local communities that needed a simple and straightforward solution.

At some point, after securing funding, the project veered off its intended course. The noble idea of building a "trust economy" devolved into the creation of yet another cryptocurrency exchange. Thus, the ambitious dream of a global mutual credit network was cast aside in favor of a more commercially viable, but mundane, model.

We decided to step back and ask ourselves: if we discard excess complexity, what's simplest GEO version we can implement to bring benefit right now?

Thus **GEO v0.1** was born — lightened but honest protocol and architecture for real communities, without illusions about "tomorrow 10 million users".

## What Exactly We Invented and Described

GEO project in new edition now has several foundational documents and ideas.

First — **GEO v0.1 protocol** itself. It describes humanely but sufficiently formally what entities exist in system: participants with cryptographic identifiers, equivalents, trust lines, debts, transactions. It also prescribes how payment looks from network perspective, how route is chosen through trust connections, how errors are handled, how cycle clearing works.

Second — **MVP GEO architecture for local community**. We didn’t limit to theory but detailed how this can work practically: one “community hub” that stores data, coordinates payments and clearing, provides an interface to participants. Participant enters through mobile app, generates key locally, creates trust lines, makes payments, sees their state.

Hub meanwhile doesn't "own" money and doesn't make decisions for people. It simply executes general rules embedded in protocol: checks limits, ensures nobody exceeds trusted credit bounds, seeks netting opportunities.

Third — concept of **network unification of such hubs**. If one hub is one district, city or cooperative economy, then several hubs connected by trust lines can already form network. And then resident of one community can, under certain conditions, get something from another community participant. All by same general rules, without centralized control in one place.

## How This Could Look Live

Imagine small town with local cooperative, several initiative entrepreneurs, couple dozen self-employed specialists. They gather and decide: let's try GEO.

Hub is raised — open source server. Web client connects to it. People register, generate keys locally, create trust lines to each other. Someone trusts neighbor-repairman for certain amount in local unit, someone — local bakery, someone — education club.

First payments appear. Person repairs someone's kitchen — gets record "you're owed X units" for this. They spend these units at local cafe or with tutor. Debts and credits travel through network, but overall balances: nobody can go into crazy minus because trust limits are restricted.

After some time system starts finding cycles and proposing participants collapse them. People see how their debts slightly decrease without explicit money participation. This helps free new exchange opportunities.

Several months later participants have graphs: who in community is especially active, where bottlenecks are, who gives too much trust and uses it too little, and who — vice versa. Power here belongs not to papers and bank accounts, but to connections and agreements, yet they're fixed in transparent system.

If several such hubs exist, they can start communicating with each other. One cooperative gives trust to another, first inter-community deals appear between them. Thus gradually what original GEO initially wanted is born: distributed internet of value, only not over abstract tokens but around living communities.

## Why We're Telling This and Who We're Calling

GEO project as we're now rethinking it isn't ready "out-of-box" product, but living constructor. It's set of protocols, architectural solutions and, hopefully soon — working prototypes that can be tried in real life.

Important to gather around this those who care about money, trust and local economies. If you're developer and interested in writing code not only for conversion and banners, but for real communities — you'll have things to do here. If you've encountered LETS, time banks, cooperatives, alternative currencies — your experience is priceless: you already know what works and what doesn't, and which "sectarian" practices better to stay away from.

If you're community organizer, public figure, urban activist — perhaps GEO will become that "missing link" lacking between mutual aid idea and real sustainable exchange.

We also need economists, lawyers, researchers who'll help not go into naivety: important to understand what legal frameworks we can work in, how to combine such system with taxes, how not to conflict with regulators, and better — be useful to them.

We don't promise quick miracles, don't distribute free tokens and don't offer "earn X percent per month". We propose participating in careful but ambitious experiment: try making money bit more humane — from bottom, through local trust networks, not from top, through reforms and decrees.

If thought resonates that part of economy can be built not on fear and scarcity, but on trust and transparency — perhaps GEO is exactly space worth looking into.
